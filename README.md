## 1. Introduction
I don't know if anyone have the same problem as I did. That everytime you learn a new algorithm or a data structure, though, you completly understand it you still forget about it after some period of time.
So, I came up with an idea to help my self while practicing my coding techniques. I'm going to build a website about data structures and algorithms. Whenever I forget them, I can just get here get my memories back.

### 1.1 Technique 
React.js
Yeah, just React.js. No server, no databases becuase I don't even sure whether I'm going to pull complete the whole project. So it's better just keep it simple.
